## Planning your trip

* [Fill out this Google Form to inform us of your plans to attend](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc94p1QnjrFbVjWTch454LbhIfDDplVDi7bE8UC8Emzep2WuQ/viewform) Because getting to Shoals can be logitically complicated, informing us of your travel plans can be helpful if any delays arise.

### Getting reimbursed

Northeastern University is managing the RCN and **does not process per diem reimbursements.** Please save all your travel receipts (food, taxi, etc.) for reimbursement. We will cover reimbursement paperwork during the workshop.

### Life on the island

The facility is a field station and the important things to know are that the facilities are not designed for accessibility, there is not a great deal of privacy, and the conditions can occasionally be uncomfortable; especially in poor weather.  August is generally an amazing time for Appledore weather, but there are always exceptions.  They have a strict no-pet policy to protect the wildlife and ecosystem of the island.  They are very conscientious about allergies and dietary restrictions.  Generally, if a person can eat in a restaurant, they can be accommodated in our dining facility.

There is no air conditioning. There will be wi-fi access, and there IS cell reception.

You many want to bring a bathing suit or snorkeling gear to cool off.

Bring sheets (fitted sheet, top sheet, and pillow case). Some guests find it easier to bring a sleeping bag! The mattresses are long twins. Shoals will provide blankets and pillows!
